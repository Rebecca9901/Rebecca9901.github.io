  <section class="about-text">

    <p>Pet’s Perfect Fetch is a small handmade studio dedicated to creating thoughtful, expressive accessories for pets of every personality. Each bow is designed with care, combining soft textures, warm neutral tones, and a playful sense of charm. Our goal is to help pets feel stylish, comfortable, and deeply loved by the humans who choose pieces for them.</p>

    <p>We value craftsmanship, kindness, and creativity. Every bow is cut, shaped, and finished by hand, ensuring quality that lasts through everyday adventures. We believe that small details — a soft ribbon edge, a gentle color palette, a secure clip — make a big difference in how pets look and feel.</p>

    <p>Our mission is simple: create accessories that spark joy for pets and their families. Whether it’s a seasonal bow, a custom design, or a charity-supporting piece, our work is rooted in care and connection. Pet’s Perfect Fetch celebrates the bond between people and pets, one handmade accessory at a time.</p>
